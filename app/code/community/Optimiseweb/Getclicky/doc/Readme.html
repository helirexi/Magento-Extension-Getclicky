<h3><b><u>Important:</u></b></h3>

<p>To be able to develop the module further and provide better support, we capture your Magento version, module version, admin URL and admin email address when you access the admin &gt; module settings page. We do not share this data with anyone. We do not use this data to send you marketing communication. We do this purely for support and statistical purposes.</p>

<p>If you do not agree to this, please do not install the module. Or, write to us to request a bespoke version of the module.</p>
